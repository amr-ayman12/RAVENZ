        <h2>BMW</h2>
        <p class="brand-description"> In the realm of luxury and high-performance automobiles, four iconic brands stand
            out, each carrying a unique heritage and origin story. We begin with BMW, the German company that started
            its journey in 1916 in Munich under the name Bayerische Motoren Werke (Bavarian Motor Works). BMW didn't
            initially dive into car manufacturing; its beginnings were in producing aircraft engines, followed by
            motorcycles, before taking its first steps into the automotive world in 1929. BMW quickly established itself
            as a maker of luxurious cars that blend exhilarating sporty performance with innovative technologies,
            achieving significant success in various motorsport events and introducing groundbreaking technologies like
            the Anti-lock Braking System (ABS).</p>
